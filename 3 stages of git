The Three States - http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Git-Basics
Now, pay attention. This is the main thing to remember about Git if you want the rest of your learning process to go smoothly. 

Git has three main states that your files can reside in: committed, modified, and staged. 

Committed means that the data is safely stored in your GIT repository. 

Modified means that you have changed the file on your working drive but have not committed it to your database yet. 

Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot. - to be placed on the repository

You can be Modified or Committed
Modified can be Staged, or not.

Existing:
You check out COMMITTED files from the git directory/respository
You work on them (MODIFIED) in your working directory (local save?)
You put them in the staging area (STAGED)
COMMIT them to the repository

New
STAGE THEM
COMMIT THEM

The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer.

The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.

The staging area is a simple file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. It’s sometimes referred to as the index, but it’s becoming standard to refer to it as the staging area.
